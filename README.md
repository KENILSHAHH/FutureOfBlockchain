# üèó SpruceDAO
SpruceDao lets users create  Dao/DataDaos with an entry barrier of their SpruceId credentials (github/twitter/email). After setting up the requirements while creating the DAO, the users who wish to join the dao first needs to verify using their credentials using spruceId. Once verified they can join the DAO and make proposals, vote the current proposals and even lend/borrow money from fellow DAO users using Union Finance
